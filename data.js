      "MboaLab is an open and collaborative space located in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The aim of MboaLab is to catalyse sustainable local development and improve people’s living conditions through open science. MboaLab is an open and collaborative space located in the village of Mefou-Assi, Yaoundé, Cameroon. \nThe word “Mboa” has different meanings in native Cameroonian languages: in Matakam, it means “new”; in Ewondo, it means “unique”; in Duala, it means “village”. Literally translated, MboaLab is a unifying village dedicated to creation; even better, it is a laboratory for social innovation, community education, collaboration and mediation at the service of the community."
